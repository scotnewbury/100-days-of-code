## Log

### R1D6 - Monday 2021-06-08
Shifted gears today and spent a little time reviewing some javascript basics - don't wnat to let the skill set slip too much while learning python.

### R1D5 - Sunday, 2021-0-06
Took a detour today and did some work with the phonenumbers module after seeing a tutorial on it. Switched things up a bit from the tutorial but taking user input instead of hard coding the numbers or pulling from a text file. Included an if statement to deal with blank results.

### R1D4 - Saturday, 2021-06-05
Continued with the basics today, created some simple scripts instead of following along to reinforce material covered in the course lectures. 

### R1D3 - Friday, 2021-06-04
Back on track after missng a couple of days due to work requirements. Today I went back to basics, practiced with typing variables and conditional statements.

### R1D2 - Tuesday, 2021-06-01
Opted to build a small madlib program for the terminal. Used input to collect user suggestions and then deplayed output using the tripple quote method for a text block and formatted string notation for the substitutions.

### R1D1 - Monday, 2021-05-31
Spent the day working through the basics of the python and started working some of the python katas on codewars.

### R1D0 - Sunday, 2021-05-30
I've  made the decision to shift gears and dig into Python. It's a language that I've poked at over the years and made a few scripts using but never focused on it.
